For the Soup: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden, about 7 minutes. Add cumin and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Stir in potatoes, lentils, carrots, stock, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to a simmer. Cook, covered, until potatoes, lentils, and carrots are tender, about 15 minutes.
For the Pita Chips (optional): While soup cooks, line a large plate with paper towels. Heat about 1/4 inch olive oil in a large stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Working in two batches, add half of pita squares and cook, stirring and flipping pita often, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes, taking care not to let them darken too much. Using a slotted spoon, immediately transfer to prepared plate and season with salt to taste.
Once soup is cooked, transfer lentil mixture to a blender. Blend on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, blend soup with an immersion blender until smooth.) Divide soup between serving bowls and top with parsley and pita chips, if using. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.
