Tear tofu into bite size pieces and place in a large mixing bowl. Add soy sauce and chilli crisp oil and gently toss to coat. Sprinkle over cornstarch and toss to coat once more. Place in the basket of an air fryer and air fry at 200C for 25 minutes, shaking the basket every 5 minutes to toss the tofu. If using an oven, preheat to 400F and bake tofu on a parchment of silicone lined baking sheet for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway through.
While the tofu is air frying/ baking, in a small bowl whisk together soy sauce, mirin, vegan oyster sauce, rice vinegar, chili crisp, cornstarch and water.
In a wok or medium size pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Add green onion whites and sauté until translucent, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant. Whisk the sauce once more to make sure the cornstarch hasn't settled to the bottom, and pour into the wok. Stir the sauce constantly with a wooden spoon for 2-3 minutes until thickened. Add crispy tofu, green onion greens and sesame oil. Gently toss to combine.
Serve with rice, broccoli and/or edamame, extra green onion and sesame seeds.
