**4 servings**

---

- 2 1/4 pounds radishes, without greens (1kg; about 30 medium radishes), larger radishes halved or quartered so that all pieces are roughly the same size (see note)
- Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling
- Kosher salt
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter (40g; 45ml)
- Minced fresh tarragon and parsley leaves, for garnish

---

Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
In a medium mixing bowl, toss radishes with just enough olive oil to coat and season with salt. Arrange in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet and roast in oven, stirring occasionally, until radishes are tender and very lightly browned, about 40 minutes.
In a medium skillet, melt butter. Add radishes and toss to coat. Remove from heat and stir in just enough minced herbs to lightly coat radishes. Season with salt, if needed. Serve.
