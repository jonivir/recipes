*Main, easy*

---

- 450g of tinned chickpeas
- 1 garlic clove
- 2 anchovies, chopped
- 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil, plus a drizzle at the end
- 1 tbsp of tomato purée, or diced tomatoes
- 1 sprig of rosemary, needles picked and roughly chopped
- 1.4l stock, (beef or vegetable)
- 200g of pasta, small shapes such as ditalini or macaroni
- sea salt
- freshly ground black pepper

---

To begin, drain and rinse the chickpeas. Set aside

Slice the garlic clove and sauté in the extra virgin olive oil on a medium–low heat for about 1 minute or until fragrant. Add the anchovies and stir well until melted

Add the tomatoes, chickpeas and rosemary. Stir then pour in the stock

Season with salt to taste, mix well, cover and leave to cook for 15 minutes


Cook the pasta of your choice in the chickpea soup, stirring often so the pasta doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. You may need to add some warm water or extra stock depending on how long your pasta takes to cook. You want to keep the soup a bit runny, as it will thicken once off the heat

Serve warm with freshly ground pepper on the top and a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil
