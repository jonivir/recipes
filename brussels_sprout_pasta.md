Trim root ends from 1 lb. brussels sprouts, letting any larger outer leaves fall off. Place leaves in a medium bowl. Coarsely chop remaining sprouts and transfer to same bowl as leaves; set aside.
Cook 1 lb. mezze rigatoni or other medium pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 2 minutes less than package directions. Drain, reserving 2 cups pasta cooking liquid.
Heat 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter and 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a medium Dutch oven or other heavy pot over medium-high until butter is melted. Add 1 cup coarsely chopped raw pecans and cook, stirring constantly, until nuts are darkened in color and fragrant and butter mixture browns (it will be slightly darker than plain brown butter because of the pecans), about 2 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, stir in ¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and season with salt. Wipe out pot.
Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in same pot over medium-high. Cook 1 lb. hot Italian sausage, casings removed if needed, breaking up with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced, and reserved brussels sprouts; season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until brussels sprouts are slightly wilted, 2–3 minutes.
Add pasta, 1 cup reserved pasta cooking liquid, 1 oz. Pecorino, finely grated (about ½ cup), and remaining 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter; season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring constantly and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until pasta is coated and sauce is glossy, 2–3 minutes. Remove pasta from heat and stir in 2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar. Taste and season with more salt if needed.
Divide pasta among shallow bowls and top with buttery pecans, dividing evenly, and more Pecorino.
