In a large Dutch oven, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add half of the mushrooms and cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are light golden brown all over and tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Season with salt, then remove to a medium bowl; set aside. Melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat and repeat with remaining mushrooms.
Add remaining tablespoon of butter to the pan. Once melted, add leeks, celery, and garlic, seasoning with a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are soft and beginning to turn golden 5 to 7 minutes. Return mushrooms to the pot. Sprinkle with flour; cook, stirring constantly, until the vegetables are evenly coated and flour begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add broth, dried mushrooms, soy sauce, and thyme, stirring to incorporate. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until slightly thickened and the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, Prepare the Dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to combine. In a 1 cup liquid measuring cup, whisk egg, buttermilk, and parsley to combine. Pour buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients, followed by the melted butter. Using a fork or flexible spatula, gently mix ingredients until fully combined and a wet dough forms. (Avoid overmixing, which will result in tough dumplings.) Set aside.
Uncover pot and reduce heat to low. When stew is gently simmering, stir in cream, followed by the lemon juice. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Using 2 large spoons, work quickly to gently drop tablespoon-size portions of dumpling dough into gently simmering soup; you should have about 14 dumplings. Cover and gently simmer until dumplings are fluffy, cooked through, and have doubled in size, 12 to 15 minutes. The broth should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. (If broth still seems watery, give the pot a gentle stir, taking care not to fully submerge or break the dumplings. Let pot sit, uncovered, until broth is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. If sauce is too thick, add broth to loosen as necessary.)
Serve immediately; the broth will continue to thicken as it sits.
