- 2 medium russet potatoes, peeled and cubed (about 3-4 cups)
- 6 cups chicken broth (see notes)
- 2 stalks of kale, stems removed, finely chopped (2-3 cups)

Sausage
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven (affiliate link) over medium high heat. Brown the sausage until fully cooked.
Onions and Garlic
Add the onions and garlic to the sausage. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until soft and fragrant. FYI your house will smell AMAZING.
Potatoes and Broth
Add the potatoes and the broth. Simmer for 7-10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender. (Be careful not to let it go for too long, because the potatoes will start to get really soft.)
Finish with Cream
Add the kale and heavy cream. Simmer for 5 minutes until kale has wilted.
Serve
Season with salt and pepper, top with Parmesan for even more flavor, and dunk into that glorious broth with hot crusty bread.
